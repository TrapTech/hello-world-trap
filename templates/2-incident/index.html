<h1>Incidents</h1>
<p>
    Of course, a good trap will not only inform you about page views.
    TrapInit notifications (or <i>incidents</i>) can have multiple severities,
    depending on actions taken inside the trap.
</p>
<br />
<p>
    The below form simulates an attacker performing a SQL injection attack.
    Try entering something (or leaving the predefined values) and clicking submit.
</p>
{% if form_state == 'start' %}
<form method="post">
    <div>
        <label for="fname">Name</label>
        <input id="fname" name="fname" value="Robert"></input>
    </div>
    <div>
        <label for="sname">Surname</label>
        <input id="sname" name="sname" value="'); DROP TABLE Students;--"></input>
    </div>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
{% endif %}
{% if form_state == 'end' %}
<form>
    <p>ðŸ¤” I hope what you entered something that makes sense, because there isn't really code to check it...</p>
    <p>
        You should now see a new high-severity incident, notifying you that an attacker tried to perform
        a SQL injection.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also take note that the incident includes <i>custom data</i>
        allowing you to see the data you have submitted.
        You can see it by clicking the received incident in TrapInit, and then clicking the "{ }" button in the info pane.
    </p>
</form>

<p>
    ðŸ‘‰ Take a look at <a href="{{ url_for('step_3_bait') }}">baits</a> next.
