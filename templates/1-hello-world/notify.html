<h1>Got you! ðŸ‘€</h1>
<p>
    When entering this page, the trap contacted TrapInit
    and sent a notification about somebody entering.
</p>
<p>
    You should be able to see it in the <i>Incidents</i> tab.
    Take note that you can see some additional information -
    including the IP address of the device that opened the page.
</p>
<p>
    If you didn't receive an incident, check the trap and application logs for any potential errors.
</p>
<br />
<p>
If you're finished, you can close this tab and <a href="{{ url_for('step_1_hello_world') }}">return to the main page</a>.
