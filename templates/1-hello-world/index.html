<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hello, world!</h1>
<p>
    If you see this text, you have successfully built and ran the example TrapInit
    trap. Good job! ðŸ˜€
</p>
<p>
    Keep in mind that if you run into any problems while using this trap, don't hesitate
    to contact us at <a href="mailto:support@traptech.pl">support@traptech.pl</a>.
</p>
<p>
    This trap functions as an example of what a TrapInit trap is capable of doing,
    as well as a testing ground that everything is working correctly.
</p>
<p>
    You should see a list of steps at the left side of the screen or at the top.
    Each one allows you to discover a functionality of TrapInit traps.</p>
<br />
<p>
    The basic function of a trap is to alert you if someone enters it.
    <br />
    Since such a trap is not a resource that a normal user should use,
    this is a good first signal that someone is snooping around your infrastructure
    unauthorized.
